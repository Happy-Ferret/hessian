Multidirectionally scrolling sideview action / adventure game for the Commodore 64. Will be strongly similar to the Metal Warrior series. Work in progress, check only at your own risk!

Technical details:

- 50Hz screen update with NTSC compatibility
- 8-directional scrolling with color per each char
- 24 sprite multiplexer
- Realtime sprite depacking for all sprites, using a sprite cache
- Dynamic memory allocation for sprites & level data
- NinjaTracker V2.03 music & sound playback
- Loader based on the CovertBitops Loader V2.24 (1541/1581/FD/HD/IDE64)
- Exomizer2 compression

"The whole idea, how everything got started, demanded visionary madness. How mankind would survive the journey to another planet, if the need arose. The answer: not as humans..."
